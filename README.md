Track the price of dogecoin live in the windows notification tray.
(please note: this is my first windows program, sorry for any crashes you may experience!)

It fetches the live Dogecoin market price from https://www.cryptonator.com/api every 1min, changing the color of the icon if it's higher or lower than the previous price.

To do:
